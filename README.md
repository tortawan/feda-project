# FEDA Project

Forest-guided Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (FEDA) implementation using Random Forest to model elite solution distributions.

## Overview

FEDA is an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm that uses Random Forest classifiers to capture complex dependencies in elite solutions and generate high-quality candidate solutions for optimization problems.

## Features

- **RF-MIMIC Algorithm**: Core implementation using Random Forest for distribution modeling
- **NK-Landscape Problems**: Built-in support for NK-landscape optimization problems
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new problem types and optimization strategies
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite for reliability
